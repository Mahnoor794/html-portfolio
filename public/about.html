<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I’m Mahnoor, a passionate web developer.
  With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development, I specialize in building modern, responsive, and user-friendly websites. I’m proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and popular frameworks like React and Node.js. My focus is on creating clean, efficient code and transforming ideas into functional web applications. Whether it's a simple landing page or a complex full-stack app, I strive to bring both functionality and creativity to every project.</p>

<p>I have a background in computer science and completed The Complete Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu. This experience helped me develop strong problem-solving skills and the ability to work on real-world projects. In my portfolio, you’ll find examples of my work ranging from single-page applications to full-stack web solutions. I’m always looking for new ways to improve my skills, stay updated on the latest industry trends, and experiment with new tools and technologies.</p>

<p>In addition to coding, I enjoy working on collaborative projects and continuously learning from the developer community. I believe in writing code that not only works but is also easy to maintain and scale. If you’re looking for someone who is enthusiastic, reliable, and always eager to tackle new challenges, feel free to reach out! Let’s build something amazing together.</p>
